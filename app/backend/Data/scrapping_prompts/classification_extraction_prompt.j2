Your task is to analyze the provided cleaned HTML content and determine if it represents a news article. Please follow these guidelines:

1. Classification Criteria:
   - Identify if the page contains a complete, single news article
   - Look for typical article elements (title, author, publication date, article body)
   - Distinguish from non-article pages (landing pages, category listings, login forms, help pages)

2. Content Analysis:
   - Verify the content focuses on news, current events, or developments in any field
   - Check for journalistic structure and professional writing style
   - Ensure the content is complete and not just a preview or summary

3. Page Type Identification:
   - News Article: A full, self-contained article about any newsworthy topic
   - Non-Article: Landing pages, category pages, login pages, help sections, contact pages, etc.

Cleaned HTML Content:
{{ cleaned_html }}

Please provide your analysis in the following format:
{
    "classification": boolean,  # True if news article, False otherwise
    "title": string,       # Article title if classification is True, empty if False
    "author": string,      # Author name if classification is True, empty if False
    "body": string,        # Full article text if classification is True, empty if False
    "date_published": string  # Publication date if classification is True, empty if False
    "comment": string # small comment on how provided html can be cleaned more to facilitate task and reduce token usage. [no more than 5 sentences]
}

Provide only the structured output without additional commentary.
