Your task is to analyze a list of URLs and identify those that are likely to be legitimate news articles while avoiding potential bot traps. Please follow these criteria:

1. URL Structure Analysis:
- Look for URLs with patterns typical of news articles (e.g., article titles in the path)
- Avoid URLs with randomly generated strings or excessive numbers
- Be wary of unusual TLDs that might indicate bot traps

2. Content Type Evaluation:
- Focus on URLs likely to contain full news or scientific articles
- Exclude category pages, user-related pages, authentication pages
- Avoid e-commerce and product pages


Input URLs:
{{ urls }}

Please provide a filtered list of the most likely legitimate news article URLs from the input ( output list containing between 5 and 30 urls, each url is a string). Return only the URLs without additional commentary.
DO NOT HALLUCINATE. Only list urls that are likely to be news articles and that are in the input list.
Output format:
    likely_urls : List[str]
