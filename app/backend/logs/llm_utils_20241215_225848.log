2024-12-15 22:58:53,368 - llm_utils - INFO - looking for login url in Your task is to analyze a list of URLs from a website's landing page and identify the login page URL. Please follow these guidelines:

1. Look for URLs containing keywords related to authentication such as:
   - "login", "signin", "sign-in", "auth", "account"
   - Common variations like "log-in", "log_in", etc.

2. Consider URL patterns typical of login pages:
   - Short paths (/login, /signin)
   - Location in URL structure (often top-level)
   - Authentication-related parameters

3. Analyze the full URL structure:
   - Path indicates user authentication purpose
   - Avoid similar but unrelated pages (e.g. "login-help")

Input URLs:


Please analyze carefully to avoid bot honeypots:
- Avoid overly simple URLs like "example.com/login" that don't match the site's domain
- Prefer login URLs that include the actual website domain (e.g. "website.com/auth/login")
- Look for login pages that follow the site's established URL patterns
- Be suspicious of login endpoints that seem disconnected from the main domain
- Consider if the URL structure matches other authenticated sections of the site
- If a login URL is found: Return only that single URL as a string
- If no login URL is found: Return one string containing "None"

Do not provide any additional commentary or explanation.
